  aboutMe: "Director of Technology & Innovation at Trolet, a Montréal-based startup industrializing the circular economy for second-hand footwear. At the intersection of engineering, automation and strategy, I design the systems, machines and teams that turn circularity into industrial reality. With a background in mechanical engineering and mechatronics from Polytechnique Montréal, I lead Trolet’s technological and operational evolution, connecting the physical and digital worlds — from mechatronic design and process automation to data-driven operations and scaling strategy. I built Trolet’s first-generation prototypes (automated shoe cleaning and disinfection systems, RFID-based smart inventory, automated photo rigs) and now lead multidisciplinary teams across software, AI, mechanics and electrical to turn these prototypes into scalable, efficient systems. Beyond machines, my goal is to build processes and culture that make innovation sustainable; when technology aligns with people and purpose, it becomes an engine of impact. This is what drives me: designing the future of sustainable industry, one smart system at a time.",

      name: "Automated Shoe Cleaning System",
      description:
        "Designed and built Trolet’s first automated shoe-cleaning system, proving that a process once manual and artisanal could be engineered, automated, and elegant. A compact, 3D-printer-inspired prototype that cleans, disinfects, deodorizes, and dries a pair of shoes in under five minutes, with no human intervention. Led the entire design — from mechanics and electronics to software control — establishing the foundation of Trolet’s automation roadmap.",
