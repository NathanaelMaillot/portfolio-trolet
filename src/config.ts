  aboutMe: "Director of Technology & Innovation at Trolet, a Montréal-based startup industrializing the circular economy for second-hand footwear. At the intersection of engineering, automation and strategy, I design the systems, machines and teams that turn circularity into industrial reality. With a background in mechanical engineering and mechatronics from Polytechnique Montréal, I lead Trolet’s technological and operational evolution, connecting the physical and digital worlds from mechatronic design and process automation to data-driven operations and scaling strategy. I built Trolet’s first-generation prototypes (automated shoe cleaning and disinfection systems, RFID-based smart inventory, automated photo rigs) and now lead multidisciplinary teams across software, AI, mechanics and electrical to turn these prototypes into scalable, efficient systems.",
